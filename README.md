The dataset is **rich and multidimensional**, allowing the use of various **analytical techniques**, including:  
- Trend Analysis  
- Regional Performance Analysis  
- Customer Segmentation  

I created **interactive visualizations** such as:  
- Bar Charts  
- Line Charts  
- Pie Charts

- Scatter Plots  

These visualizations help improve **data interpretation** and assist in **decision-making**.
